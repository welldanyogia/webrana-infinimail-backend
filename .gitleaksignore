# Gitleaks Ignore File
# Use this to suppress false positives for secret scanning
# Format: commit-hash:file-path:rule-id
# Documentation: https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks#gitleaksignore

# Example test secrets (if you have intentional test credentials in code)
# abc123def456:.env.example:generic-api-key

# Instructions:
# 1. Only add entries for verified false positives
# 2. Never ignore real secrets - rotate them instead
# 3. Use specific patterns rather than wildcards when possible
# 4. Always add comments explaining why it's ignored
